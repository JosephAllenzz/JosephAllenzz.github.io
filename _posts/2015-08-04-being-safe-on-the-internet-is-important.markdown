Living in the tech world, we are bound to spend most of our time on the internet. So, almost everyone has adequate knowledge about the internet. However, there is no rose without a thorn. 
So, you should expect some of the biggest issues happening because you are living with people on the net who want to steal your data and hack into your account. 

In simple words, we need to safeguard ourselves from the negative energies. We can do it simply by following some golden rules that are noted below.

Passwords
Have a strong password!
You have heard this many times. But the reason behind it is that you need to protect your data and keep hackers at bay. 
So, have a strong password. At the same time, it is important to have a different password for every account. 
For example, if you are using the same email id for your emails, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. you should make sure that you have a different password for each and every account. So, even if you are using the same email id for different accounts, you should have a different password for every account.

Privacy settings
Well, every social network, every email account, every little thing you do on the browser will allow you to get privacy settings specifically. 
So, check for them and edit it accordingly.
Remember, we are talking about issues related to privacy. What’s worse? There are so many issues to be checked that you can get confused. In that case, you should ask an expert or know more about it at forums. 
Your safety should be your priority.

Online shopping
Yes, it is the best thing in the world, but you should know that in some cases it can be risky business. This usually happens when you shop at unreliable online sources. Online stores like Kohl’s is one of the few reliable sources that are safe and even help you get discounts on purchases. Purchasing can be fun only if you are willing to shop for necessary items at a safe, convenient online store like Kohl’s.
While shopping at Kohl’s there are people who feel that the prices offered for many products are not reasonable. If that is the case for your selected products, you can simply look for coupons. Coupons and promo codes for various online stores are available online for free. 

Even while choosing coupons and promo codes, you need to be sure that you are looking for them at reliable coupon sites. So, look for coupons and promo codes for Kohl’s at popular and reliable coupon sites online.

Public WiFi
You might feel that using public Wi-Fi is fun, and you have a better and faster alternative. So, why should you use your mobile data, right?
If your answer is affirmative, you should think again. Here is a hint - Public Wi-Fi isn’t safe.
Yes, it isn’t safe. So, if you are using personal accounts or making online transactions or passing sensitive data in any other form, the possibility of the same being hacked and stolen is high when using public Wi-Fi.
So, instead of using public Wi-Fi, choose your mobile data that is a bit slow, but safe.
Note: Public Wi-Fi is not safe, but free Wi-Fi, if secured, is a safer option. However, the options we have talked about here, mobile data is the safest option. 

Delete accounts you do not use
With hundreds of accounts registered in your name, you might rarely be using more than ten. So, make sure that you delete other accounts so that the possibility of the same being hacked is equal to zero. 
Hackers often look for dead accounts and try to break in because the users are not interested in using the same accounts again, and so they do not remember the password for the same too.
So, delete accounts you do not use and be safe.

Software download
Before downloading software, make sure that it is an authentic software, and you are downloading it from a legal and authentic source. This is extremely important in the case of free software. But researching on the software and web site hosting it, will matter because you want to be safe, and there will be no real issue later on. 

Sharing risky posts
Risky posts include ‘claim award’, ‘shocking videos’ and other illegal posts. You can get yourself into trouble, and some of these issues can be really risky that might involve your personal life too. 
So, avoid sharing these posts.

App storage
Well, storing sensitive data in your smartphone’s app can be risky. So, you should try not to save sensitive data in your smartphone’s app. Even if you want to keep it in your smartphone, make sure that strong password and locks are applied before you store anything in it. 

Stay up-to-date
Well, you need to be sure that you are updated with the latest updates in the tech world. Tech world is totally dependent and with regular updates, you can be on par with others in the tech world. 
The best part is that if there is an issue with the previous update, you will be able to stay away from it and be safe.
So, look for software updates and update them regularly. 
Note: In case you are confused with the update, search online for the pros and cons for the update and then go ahead with your planning. 

Anti-virus
Today, almost everyone has an anti-virus installed on their PCs and laptops, but it is suggested that you should check for updates and if there is a better anti-virus that is even more efficient, look for it and install it on your PCs and laptops. 

Concluding, internet is a service that has been created for the benefit of the users. However, if you do not take proper care, you will be a victim of the service that will force you to lose something or the other in your personal space.
